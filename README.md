# Line Coding Schemes

This repository provides implementations of various **line encoding schemes** in **C** and **Python**.  
Line coding is a fundamental concept in digital communication, where binary data is converted into a specific signal format for transmission over physical media.

## Features

- Implementations in **C** (text/console-based output)  
- Implementations in **Python** (with optional waveform visualization using `matplotlib`)  
- Well-structured, easy-to-read code for learning purposes  
- Extendable framework to add more encoding and decoding techniques
